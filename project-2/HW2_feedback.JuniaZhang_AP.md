Great job, I love how you included the Seaborn wrapper on the pandas DF ploting capabilities! <br>
A few thoughts: <br>
Q10: Removing outliers would a great start. But what else can you do? Perhaps some mathematical transformations, such as the log transformation you did in the bonus, are there others? <br>
Q12: What would you do if you had found highly correlated variables? Keep all, some, none? Just something to think about for your projects etc. <br>
